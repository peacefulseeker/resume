        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <div class="article-content">
            <p>A detail-oriented, results-driven full stack developer with 6+ years of experience in a software engineering environment.</p>
<p>I developed and maintained both monolithic and micro-services architecture-based applications.</p>
<p>While working in the tech-marketing area I learned the importance of accurate visitor and user journey tracking, keeping privacy in mind.</p>
<p>Being part of the growth engineering team, I learned that numbers don't lie and it's better to switch off experiments early, even if a variant is hypothetically a better version of control and "looks cooler" in the eyes of the product/developer.</p>
<p>I had a chance to work with enthusiastic UX professionals and product people and 1 major thing I learned is that putting yourself in a user's shoes for any size of feature is the best strategy to build a product users love to interact with.</p>
<p>I fell in love with the zen of Python language when I had to switch from NodeJS/JavaScript stack to Python/Django. I can also add, that switching to different tech stacks always gives me fresh insights into the existing and former problems I used to solve.</p>
